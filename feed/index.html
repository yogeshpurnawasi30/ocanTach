You can also enhance your website&#8217;s user experience or performance with a custom plugin.

<p>This brings us to the next most important question:</p>
<h2>Who is a WordPress Plugin expert, exactly?</h2>
<p>Think of a professional WordPress Plugins developer as someone who has mastered the art (and science) of WordPress Plugin development. Yep, you read that right. With all kinds of skills, WordPress Plugin development is also a hands-on skill that is mastered over years of practice with on-field, real-life website projects.</p>
<h2>Do you need a WordPress Plugin developer?</h2>
<p>The biggest question that circles most WordPress website owners is whether they should hire a WordPress developer or not. A fair question. After all, once you sign up for a WordPress account, you will have access to thousands of pre-built website templates, aka WordPress themes.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-32800" src="https://www.uplers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Capture-1024x182.jpg" alt="WordPress Plugin Statistics" width="800" height="142" srcset="https://www.uplers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Capture-1024x182.jpg 1024w, https://www.uplers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Capture-300x53.jpg 300w, https://www.uplers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Capture-768x137.jpg 768w, https://www.uplers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Capture-1536x273.jpg 1536w, https://www.uplers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Capture-624x111.jpg 624w, https://www.uplers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Capture-500x89.jpg 500w, https://www.uplers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Capture.jpg 1730w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Source: Manaferra.com</p>
<p>So, coming back to the real question: Do you need a WordPress Plugin developer The short answer? Yes.</p>
<p>Here are five compelling reasons why you should hire a WordPress Plugin developer:</p>
<h3>1. Knowledge</h3>
<p>A seasoned WordPress Developer is an expert in all things WordPress. They can understand your customized needs, eliminate key friction points, and help you to deliver a unique and personalized experience. They can also guide you on specific and relevant functionalities to add to your website and elevate the user experience. WordPress boasts over 1 billion-plus plugin downloads:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-32801" src="https://www.uplers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Capture-2.jpg" alt="WordPress Plugin Usage" width="800" height="529" srcset="https://www.uplers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Capture-2.jpg 1005w, https://www.uplers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Capture-2-300x198.jpg 300w, https://www.uplers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Capture-2-768x507.jpg 768w, https://www.uplers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Capture-2-624x412.jpg 624w, https://www.uplers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Capture-2-500x330.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Source: manaferra.com</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This data shows that WordPress plugins usage is skyrocketing. And to cope up with the highly increasing demand there is definitely a need of WordPress Plugin Developers and WordPress Plugin Experts.</p>
<h3>2. Specialized skills</h3>
<p>Many WordPress Plugin developers offer highly-specialized skills which can be useful for your website. For instance, say you want to improve your website&#8217;s performance. It makes sense to hire a back-end WordPress Plugin specialist.</p>
<h3>3. Quality over quantity</h3>
<p>Another advantage of hiring a WordPress expert is that they will focus on integrating quality plugins into your website instead of multiple plugins with no clear end value.</p>
<h3>4. Improved functionality</h3>
<p>Here&#8217;s a handy tip: If you love the design-related aesthetics of your website but have an issue with its background performance, it&#8217;s a good idea to leverage the services of a WordPress plugin expert. They bring to the table clean and speedy code that&#8217;s built to eliminate all kinds of performance and optimization issues.</p>
<h3>5. Heightened security</h3>
<p>Another rock-solid reason why you should hire plugin developers is foolproofing your website&#8217;s security. While free templates and themes are great to use, they&#8217;re also often poorly coded and can quickly become a security threat. This is where a certified WordPress plugin developer comes in handy. They will plug in the security gaps with clean code and mitigate risks along the way.</p>
<p>WordPress Plugin developers can bring your theoretical ideas to life with seamless ease, on-point customization, and reduced friction and/or effort. With over<a href="https://www.manaferra.com/wordpress-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 708 million</a> WordPress websites being active globally in 2022, creating a standout WordPress website can become a herculean task. Popular global brands such as NFL, NBC, and CNN use WordPress as their preferred CMS.</p>
<h2>How to choose a custom WordPress Plugin developer?</h2>
<p>Zeroing in on a WordPress Plugin developer requires some amount of grunt work. Here are a few tips to consider when working with a professional WordPress Plugin developer:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-32802" src="https://www.uplers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/WordPress-Plugin-Developer-1024x502.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="393" srcset="https://www.uplers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/WordPress-Plugin-Developer-1024x502.jpg 1024w, https://www.uplers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/WordPress-Plugin-Developer-300x147.jpg 300w, https://www.uplers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/WordPress-Plugin-Developer-768x377.jpg 768w, https://www.uplers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/WordPress-Plugin-Developer-624x306.jpg 624w, https://www.uplers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/WordPress-Plugin-Developer-500x245.jpg 500w, https://www.uplers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/WordPress-Plugin-Developer.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<h3>Tip #1: Think long and hard about your budget and custom WordPress plugin development requirements.</h3>
<p>Let&#8217;s call a spade a spade. The costs of working with an expert outweigh the next-to-zero costs of using a pre-built plugin/theme. Depending on your business goals and requirements, a WordPress Plugin developer may cost you anywhere between <strong>$15 to $150 an hour</strong> (and upwards). So, consider your budgetary requirements before you take the plunge.</p>
<p><strong>Pro tip: </strong><i>If you don&#8217;t need elaborate changes to be made to the website, don&#8217;t hire a WordPress Plugin developer. Instead, comb through the functionalities available in the current theme repository and add features as needed.</i></p>
<h3>Tip #2: Think about your deadline.</h3>
<p>The next critical element to consider is the kind of time you have for your website changes. If your website design is complex or if your requirements are extensive, you&#8217;ll need to leverage a professional&#8217;s services. This will add a considerable amount of time to the overall deadline (as opposed to downloading and installing a plugin).</p>
<h3>Tip #3: Focus on the developer&#8217;s quality of work.</h3>
<blockquote><p><strong><i>Over</i><a href="https://www.manaferra.com/wordpress-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> <i>661</i></a><i> new WordPress sites are popping up daily on average.</i></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<p>You&#8217;ll find plenty of WordPress Plugin developers in the freelance marketplace. But finding quality WordPress developers with a high standard of work ethic might be an uphill task. This is why it is critical to do your homework and understand where you&#8217;re going to source quality talent. When hiring the developer, make sure to ask the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">What does their charge look like?</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">What kind of work have they done in the past? A portfolio of work is a must-have for WordPress Plugin developers that showcase their strengths and capabilities.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">What kind of experience have they amassed over the years? Have they worked on multi-dimensional projects?</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Do they have any references that you can reach out to?</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">What kind of communication do they prefer (be it email, SMS, phone, and so on)?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Tip #4: Think about the type of questions the developer&#8217;ll ask you.</h3>
<p>On the flip side, your WordPress Plugin developer might have a stream of questions that they may need clarity on. These include understanding the:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Scope of the project</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Intended outcome(s) of the project</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Specific functionalities that need to be added from scratch or improved</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Timelines and budget</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> <i>You should also be able to communicate the end goal of your vision for the project. The clearer the vision, the speedier and more effective the outcome will be. </i></p>
<h2>Where can you hire a WordPress Plugin developer?</h2>

<p>So, you heard about Google AdWords and its advantages. Excited about this new venture, you try to give it a whirl &#8211; only to watch your entire budget go out in flames! Does it sound like a familiar situation? Well, you’re not alone! And for this very reason, Google AdWords consultants have created a niche for themselves in helping businesses achieve growth while maintaining profitability.</p>



<p>But how do they achieve this magical feat? Let’s take a look!</p>



<h2>How Can You Grow Your Business With a Robust Google Ads Strategy?</h2>



<p>Before talking about a Google AdWords expert, let’s talk about the impact of Google Ads. A well-planned Google Ads strategy can fetch you the following growth-focused benefits:</p>



<ol><li>
<h3>Accelerated Growth</h3>
</li></ol>



<p>Digital marketing forms the backbone of any growth hacking strategy. However, not all forms of marketing are alike. For a start, you have SEO to earn organic traffic and Google Ads (or <a href="https://www.uplers.com/blog/what-you-need-to-know-before-you-hire-ppc-expert-remotely/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PPC advertising</a>) to attract paid traffic.</p>



<p>And while both of these have a place of their own, even Google <a href="https://ads.google.com/home/resources/seo-vs-ppc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">admits</a> that AdWords delivers results faster than SEO! So, if you wish to expedite the rate of your business’ growth, Google Ads is the way to go.</p>



<ol start="2"><li>
<h3>Greater Brand Awareness</h3>
</li></ol>



<p>In the world of offline marketing, you know that ad placement matters. In its digital counterpart, you have to fight for virtual real estate. But here’s the fun part, Google Ads puts you on, well, Google &#8211; the prime location to be seen.</p>



<p>In the world of search engines, Google is an uncontested behemoth. After all, it occupies a massive <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/216573/worldwide-market-share-of-search-engines/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">86%</a> of the market share! And seeing as it is the first point of contact between users and information, popping up every now and then will get you noticed.</p>



<ol start="3"><li>
<h3>Remarket to Prospects</h3>
</li></ol>



<p>You may have noticed how after you have visited a website, the company or its offerings show up in the various ads that show up as you scroll through the internet. This is the magic of Google Ads.</p>



<p>The fact that you have shown interest is enough to cause companies to nudge you into the funnel. Such a marketing tactic converts losses into sales, which will obviously lead to growth.</p>



<ol start="4"><li>
<h3>Decimate Competition</h3>
</li></ol>



<p>Google Ads is no longer a nice-to-have feature but an absolute necessity for businesses to stand out. So, if you feel that you are doing just fine and do not need to strategize Google Ads campaigns at this juncture, then your competitors will. And by the time (or if at all) you manage to catch up, they would have already perfected the strategy &#8211; essentially routing you from the competition.</p>

<h2>4 Ways in Which Google AdWords Expert Can Boost Business Growth</h2>



<p>If you are wondering whether AdWords consulting services are right for you, consider what a Google AdWords expert brings to the table:</p>



<h3>#1 Lend Direction to Your Google Ads Campaign</h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://images.surferseo.art/a14c36c9-5d52-4ad4-b728-f484d5204f32.jpeg" alt="PPC campaign"/></figure></div>



<p>Even an arrow will miss its mark if you don’t lend it direction &#8211; and this is a <em>paid </em>ad campaign that we are talking about! So, unless you have deep pockets, you cannot even afford to go down the trial and error path.</p>



<p>As such, you need to have a worthy captain at the helm of affairs to help navigate any choppy waters. Every AdWords consultant will resort to their tried and tested practices to plan out this journey before you take sail. And once you are at sea, the Google Ads consultant will also ensure that the scenic views do not take away the focus from the final destination. Their proactive involvement in managing the expedition eventually leads to success.</p>



<p>And so, whether you are looking to build brand awareness, expand reach, generate leads, win sales, attract traffic, and promote certain products, an Google Ads consultant who knows the ins and outs of Google Ads can chart the best path to go about it.</p>



<h3>#2 Improve Quality Score and Increase Awareness</h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://images.surferseo.art/7580d099-fbc1-4cc2-b6d3-c8f5fa1f5c3e.jpeg" alt="Best Google Ads"/></figure></div>



<p>Quality Score is a critical component that governs your ad’s popularity. This ten-point scale is directly linked to the usefulness and relevance of your ad. It also accounts for the historical performance of your Google Ads account. Based on such factors, the Google search engine evaluates your ad to make key decisions such as slashing the cost per click (CPC) or ranking the ad higher. In simple words, if you could improve your Quality Score, you can generate greater brand awareness and reduce the costs associated with it.</p>



<p>And here’s where an Google Ads consultant will prove to be your competitive differentiator.</p>



<p>A Google Ads consultants will leverage their experience to devise strategies to improve the Quality Score. While a layman may simply work on improving the quality of the ad through copywriting, the Google Ads consultants will follow a more holistic approach. As such, you will notice them working on improving the user experience of the website, speeding up load times, segmenting campaigns into SKAGs (Single Keyword Ad Groups), incorporating personalization, and more! Such efforts will yield results as you witness the conversion rates climb. This resulting increase in Google Ads performance will not go unnoticed as you will be rewarded with an impressive Quality Score.</p>



<h3>#3 Design Landing Pages That Convert</h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://images.surferseo.art/d7cc6b47-ea15-496d-81ba-869be829998c.jpeg" alt="Expert Google Ads"/></figure></div>



<p>The landing page experience also contributes to the Quality Score of your ad. And even if it weren’t so, the fact that it is the link between the customer, the advertisement that drew them in, and the business, the landing page needs to maintain a certain charm to ensure stickiness and no drop-offs.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, businesses simply overlook or cannot afford a dedicated landing page designer, which causes them to slack off on this front. As such, having a consultant for Google AdWords can prove to be instrumental in helping businesses grow.</p>



<p>The AdWords consultant will follow the best practices to design and optimize the landing pages to align user expectations to drive conversions. The strategies would involve a range of activities such as, but not limited to, improving the landing page content, incorporating keywords in the copy, upgrading the quality of rich media used on the landing page, deciding on the number of form fields to make it “just enough”, adding emotional and actionable CTAs, optimizing the page for multiple devices, and tracking conversions. Clearly, this is quite a responsibility that cannot be limited to a content writer, web page designer, graphic designer, etc., which all the more stresses the importance of hiring an Google AdWords consultant.</p>



<h3>#4&nbsp; Test and Optimize</h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://images.surferseo.art/ce3c4962-170c-4e26-9c3d-ebafb6f6c97d.jpeg" alt="Google Ads Optimization "/></figure></div>



<p>In marketing and advertising, no strategy is perfect right out the gate. As such, it must undergo rigorous testing, more so when your money is on the line.</p>



<p>The AdWords consultant typically performs split testing, also known as A/B Testing, to understand audience preferences. This testing methodology involves the creation of two versions of a web page or an ad. These changes are rather minor, say, the wording of the heading is different, two color schemes, placement or wording of CTAs, or information layout or presentation. The standard one (original) acts as a control and the second is the variation. The performance of these entities is then compared to see which is received favorably and then the necessary improvements will be made to them.</p>



<p>The Google AdWords expert will iterate these tests until your business discovers the best version of the ad or web page that maximizes revenue. Resultantly, your campaigns will be more value-driven and gain greater traction.</p>



<h2>Measure Your Success: Key AdWords Metrics That Indicate Growth</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://images.surferseo.art/5da25cb7-ad6d-4cb9-9cfe-5de6862b19b6.jpeg" alt="Google Ads Key Metrics"/></figure></div>



<p>Businesses can use the following metrics as a diagnostic tool to determine the effectiveness of their Google Ads campaign:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Number of clicks: </strong>Since a click is the first step to conversion, knowing the number of clicks attracted by an ad will indicate the campaign’s success.</li><li><strong>Click-Through Rate (CTR):</strong> CTR is a refined variant of the previous KPI wherein the number of clicks is pitted against the total impressions. As such, it lends insight into how appealing the audiences find your ad.</li><li><strong>Quality Score: </strong>We have already talked about Quality Score and how an AdWords Consultant can increase it. Just to recap, it is a numerical value computed by accounting for the expected CTR, ad relevance, and landing page UX for pricing and placing the ads.</li><li><strong>Cost-Per-Click (CPC):</strong> As the name indicates, CPC is the numerical equivalent of the price you pay for every click. While it also has underlying factors such as keywords popularity, bid competition, and Quality Score, a high CPC normally points toward unsustainable advertising.</li><li><strong>Conversion Rate (CVR):</strong> If you had to monitor only one KPI in your Google Ads campaign, then this would have to be it. It quantifies the number of people who viewed your ad, clicked on it, interacted with the CTA, and successfully converted into paying customers.</li><li><strong>Cost per Conversion:</strong> Also known as Cost Per Acquisition (CPA), this KPI tracks the budget with respect to the number of customers acquired to make a sale. It lends clarity to the cost-effectiveness of the campaign.</li><li><strong>Cost per Mille (CPM):</strong> This metric denotes the amount you have to invest to get 1,000 impressions on your ad. In other words, it helps test the cost-effectiveness of the campaign w.r.t its reach.</li></ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What do<a href="https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/cm-wordpress" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 43%</a> of global websites have in common? You guessed it, it is WordPress! And if you were to just focus on Content Management Systems (CMS), WordPress occupies a lion’s share of the market at 64%! In simple words, WordPress is <i>HUGE</i>. One can even say that it is a towering lighthouse lending direction to businesses in reaching their goals. However, the problem starts when a WordPress expert comes drawn to this lighthouse, like moths to the flame.</p>
<p>Unlike other industries, where talent shortage is a genuine problem, WordPress experiences quite the opposite. There are just too many WordPress developers! After all, WordPress was designed to be easy, the WordPress community is helpful and thriving, and developers from any background can adapt to work on WordPress. This must be a good sign, right? On the contrary, it’s not!</p>
<p>As any recruiting manager who has worked with a saturated market knows, with high volume comes quality issues. Accordingly, you are more at risk of making a bad hire. Which is going to cost your company time and money.</p>
<p>So, how does one go about navigating these challenges to pick the best of WordPress experts? Well, here’s an elaborate guide <i>just </i>for you!</p>
<h2>Types of WordPress Experts</h2>
<p>If this is your first time hiring WordPress experts, it would be best to familiarize yourself with the different types of WordPress developers that may cross your path. The following is a quick refresher:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-32389 size-large" src="https://www.uplers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Types-of-WordPress-Experts-770x1024.jpg" alt="Types of WordPress Experts" width="625" height="831" srcset="https://www.uplers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Types-of-WordPress-Experts-770x1024.jpg 770w, https://www.uplers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Types-of-WordPress-Experts-226x300.jpg 226w, https://www.uplers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Types-of-WordPress-Experts-768x1021.jpg 768w, https://www.uplers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Types-of-WordPress-Experts-1155x1536.jpg 1155w, https://www.uplers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Types-of-WordPress-Experts-624x830.jpg 624w, https://www.uplers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Types-of-WordPress-Experts-376x500.jpg 376w, https://www.uplers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Types-of-WordPress-Experts.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" /></p>
<h3>Freelance WordPress Experts</h3>
<p>As the name indicates, a freelance WordPress expert is a self-employed developer who works without intermediaries. They will work with you on a project-to-project basis and will charge you a flat-rate fee, hourly fee, or retainer. You can find such talent on freelancing platforms or by referrals within your network.</p>
<p>Hiring a WordPress freelancer works out to be cheaper, and you get access to a wealth of options. However, it could also add to your responsibility of vetting talent while still subjecting the project to a certain amount of risk.</p>
<h3>Full-Time In-House WordPress Experts</h3>
<p>These are dedicated WordPress experts that the business has recruited. They are a part of your staff, operate from within the office, and enjoy all the employee perks and benefits that your company extends to its workforce.</p>
<p>With full-time, in-house WordPress experts, you can be sure that your project is in good hands. They will work on creating custom and branded solutions, work solely on your project, and be readily available. However, hiring a full-time, in-house WordPress developer can prove to be expensive as you will have to compensate them even if you are not availing their services. Plus, the requirement to physically attend the office means that you will have to hunt for WordPress developers near me, limiting the talent pool.</p>
<h3>Full-Time Remote Dedicated WordPress Experts</h3>
<p>Since geographic location can be an issue while hiring full-time, in-house WordPress experts, opting to hire a remote WordPress expert makes more sense. They function much like a dedicated WordPress expert, except that they do not have to show up at work.</p>
<p>As such, they offer the same benefits while mitigating location issues. Further, even though they are still on your payroll, they can prove to be slightly more cost-effective as it is a remote position (as<a href="https://www.goodhire.com/resources/articles/state-of-remote-work-survey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 61%</a> of employees would rather choose a pay cut than work from the office!). Some may complain that communication can pose to be an issue while working with a remote developer, not to mention that the problem worsens if they are located at a different time zone. However, it is not an insurmountable issue given the options available for synchronous and asynchronous communication and the widespread adoption of the same. As such, even if the teams are spread across geographies and time zones, they can still work collaboratively.</p>
<h3>Contract-Based In-House WordPress Experts</h3>
<p>Contract-based, in-house WordPress experts are recruited through third-party agencies. These agencies test and evaluate the skillset of their teams and offer you their services on a contract basis. Resultantly, your developers are ready to get working from the word go. The costs would be easier on the pocket while you still enjoy a good degree of control over the WordPress development project. However, you will still have to provide infrastructure to the WordPress developers as they will be working out of your office space. Also, maintaining culture against workforce heterogeneity can prove to be a challenge.</p>
<h3>Contract-Based Remote WordPress Experts</h3>
<p>Against all the different types of WordPress experts discussed so far, contract-hiring a remote WordPress web developer appears to be the holy grail! You get instant hiring, scalable teams, flexibility, control, project guarantee, access to wider talent pools, and moderate costs. You also do not have to deal with providing infrastructure to remote workers as they will work on their own devices. As for the management and coordination of remote developers, you won’t have to worry as much about it as the third-party agency would often step in to assist. The only tangible disadvantage would be finding a reliable talent agency that can balance everything.</p>
<h2>Freelance WordPress Developer vs Dedicated WordPress Developer</h2>
<p>From the above description of WordPress experts, the differences between freelance and dedicated WordPress developers may seem obvious. Regardless, here’s a quick table to summarize the same:</p>
<table border="1">

</tr>
<tr>
<td>Access to global talent pools</td>
<td>Recruitment is limited to co-located talent</td>

<td>Can prove to be costly as you have to invest in infrastructure. Plus, you will have to offer a transport allowance for in-house WordPress developers</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Control and management can be an issue</td>
<td>Since they come under direct supervision, project control and management are not an issue</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Team bonding, communication, and collaboration can be challenging</td>
<td>Teams can work together seamlessly</td>

<td>In-House WordPress programmers can easily fall prey to burnout and inefficiency</td>

<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-32401 size-full" src="https://www.uplers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Freelancer.jpg" alt="Freelancer" width="323" height="156" srcset="https://www.uplers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Freelancer.jpg 323w, https://www.uplers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Freelancer-300x145.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 323px) 100vw, 323px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Source: Freelancer.com</p>
<p>Freelancer is a popular online job marketplace. You can use this platform to connect with a vast community of freelancers (beyond WordPress web developers, designers, programmers, etc.). However, you are responsible for posting listings, reviewing profiles, and selecting the right candidates, which means that you will have to do all the legwork <i>and</i> the due diligence before making the hire. Further, given the popularity of this platform, the quality of freelancers available can really vary from meh to extraordinary. As such, it will be <i>exhausting</i> to find the WordPress expert you need within the timelines.</p>
<h3>Upwork</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-32402 size-full" src="https://www.uplers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/UpWork.jpg" alt="UpWork" width="1601" height="853" srcset="https://www.uplers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/UpWork.jpg 1601w, https://www.uplers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/UpWork-300x160.jpg 300w, https://www.uplers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/UpWork-1024x546.jpg 1024w, https://www.uplers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/UpWork-768x409.jpg 768w, https://www.uplers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/UpWork-1536x818.jpg 1536w, https://www.uplers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/UpWork-624x332.jpg 624w, https://www.uplers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/UpWork-500x266.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 1601px) 100vw, 1601px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Source: Upwork.com</p>
<p>Upwork is essentially Freelancer &#8211; but on steroids. As a result, you can see higher views on your job listing, more responses, more options, and WordPress experts who can outdo each other. The hyper-competitive environment is not for faint-hearted recruiters. Especially since you are once again responsible for carrying out due diligence while engaging a WordPress freelancer from Upwork. So, if you are prepared to be knee-deep in applications and dig through it all to find appreciable talent, then it is worth the consideration.</p>
<h3>Toptal</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-32404 size-full" src="https://www.uplers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Toptal.jpg" alt="Toptal" width="1832" height="711" srcset="https://www.uplers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Toptal.jpg 1832w, https://www.uplers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Toptal-300x116.jpg 300w, https://www.uplers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Toptal-1024x397.jpg 1024w, https://www.uplers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Toptal-768x298.jpg 768w, https://www.uplers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Toptal-1536x596.jpg 1536w, https://www.uplers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Toptal-624x242.jpg 624w, https://www.uplers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Toptal-500x194.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 1832px) 100vw, 1832px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Source: Toptal.com</p>
<p>Toptal boasts of allowing companies to hire from the top 3% of freelance talent. Such a lucrative headline is sufficient to have recruiters flocking to it for their diverse requirements. Not just WordPress experts, or tech experts for that matter, but you can also engage financial gurus to steer your business. Of course, since the platform puts a lot of work into screening candidates, and only the best of lot make it through, the prices are not low. Strangely, you might find the same freelancer available on other platforms for a lower cost! So, you might want to cross-reference the costs if you wish to cash in on some savings.</p>
<h3>Codeable</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-32407" src="https://www.uplers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Codeable-1024x568.jpg" alt="Codeable" width="625" height="347" srcset="https://www.uplers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Codeable-1024x568.jpg 1024w, https://www.uplers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Codeable-300x166.jpg 300w, https://www.uplers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Codeable-768x426.jpg 768w, https://www.uplers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Codeable-1536x852.jpg 1536w, https://www.uplers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Codeable-624x346.jpg 624w, https://www.uplers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Codeable-500x277.jpg 500w, https://www.uplers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Codeable.jpg 1552w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" /></p>
<p>Codeable is a WordPress-centric talent engagement platform that works with only the best freelance WordPress experts. Its focus on WordPress ensures that you will easily find WordPress specialists for all your business requirements without having to search far and wide. However, the professional, well-groomed talent that you get off of Codeable will also attract professional rates, so expect to pay a minimum of $70 per hour, which means that long-drawn projects are bound to get pricey.</p>
<h3>People Per Hour</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-32409 size-full" src="https://www.uplers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/PeoplePerHour.jpg" alt="People Per Hour" width="1860" height="868" srcset="https://www.uplers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/PeoplePerHour.jpg 1860w, https://www.uplers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/PeoplePerHour-300x140.jpg 300w, https://www.uplers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/PeoplePerHour-1024x478.jpg 1024w, https://www.uplers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/PeoplePerHour-768x358.jpg 768w, https://www.uplers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/PeoplePerHour-1536x717.jpg 1536w, https://www.uplers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/PeoplePerHour-624x291.jpg 624w, https://www.uplers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/PeoplePerHour-500x233.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 1860px) 100vw, 1860px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Source: Peopleperhour.com</p>
<p>While People Per Hour follows the same freelancer marketplace approach as Freelancer, Upwork, and Fiverr, the contests (aka Hourlies) make the model more interesting. The entire process, from posting jobs, connecting with freelancers, and paying for the hours worked, is seamless. Apart from connecting with the global talent base, People Per Hour can help you seek local WordPress developers who can possibly become a regular fixture in your office if you were to have an in-house team!</p>
<h2>Tips to Find and Hire the Best WordPress Experts</h2>
<p>If you wish to eliminate the guesswork and bypass the trial and error method of hiring WordPress developers, the following are a few tips that will help:</p>
<h3>Eyes on the Prize</h3>
<p>As seen already, certain WordPress projects, such as designing, customization, plugin development, etc., may require niche skills. As such, the last thing you want is to find WordPress experts, only to have them politely back out at a critical stage. Hence, rather than keeping a broad goal, try to keep it as specific as possible so that you do not lose focus of it.</p>
<h3>Prepare a Project Outline</h3>
<p>Once you have a single goal in mind, you need to plan for it. At this stage, it would be best to prepare a project outline containing the objectives, project scope, deliverables, resources, timelines, etc. Documenting these specifics will set expectations right from the start, even before you engage talent and kick off the project &#8211; which is the best form of risk management. If you have a project manager on your team, you can always seek their input here.</p>
<h3>Craft a Detailed Job Description</h3>
<p>Now that the expectations have been laid out, it will be easier for you to create a job description that aligns with the requirement and reflects the key roles and responsibilities of the WordPress expert. Make sure that the listing is clear, easy to understand, and unambiguous.</p>
<h3>Keep a List of Questions</h3>
<p>Recruiters cannot be masters of all subjects for which they hire (or they wouldn’t have to look elsewhere in the first place!) As such, noting down a list of questions to ask during the interview can help you vet talent as per your requirement. You can even involve a seasoned WordPress developer as an interview panel member to grill them on technical topics.</p>
<h3>Paid Trial Tasks</h3>
<p>If you are not in a hurry to onboard and start working with a WordPress developer, you can give the shortlisted candidates a paid trial task to assess their skills. After all, their performance in a practical, professional setting would speak volumes about their eligibility &#8211; more than their profiles or CVs. It also helps you make a more befitting offer that is proportionate to their skills.</p>
<h3>Look for Reviews</h3>
<p>Whether you follow a DIY approach to engaging a freelancer or want a dedicated WordPress expert on your team, performing is a background check on the individual, or the agency should be on top of your list. Look up reviews, search their socials, and ask for referrals, recommendation letters, portfolios, or case studies to verify their credibility.</p>
<h3>Discuss Communication</h3>
<p>Communication would play a central role in your project’s success, especially if you have remote WordPress developers on your team. As such, layout a plan on how you plan on sustaining synchronous and asynchronous communication, along with a list of preferred tools and channels.</p>
<h3>Plan for Updates</h3>
<p>You would require frequent updates from the WordPress developer (or teams). And so, it would be best to set the cadence right at the start. Depending on the project length and complexity, you could go for a daily update or a monthly one. Further, you can also dictate the form and format of these updates (sprint meetings, presentations, reports, etc.) so that you can pick a common language.</p>
<h3>Draw Up a Contract</h3>
<p>Once you have ironed out all the details and mutually agreed upon the terms of recruitment or engagement, it is only a matter of setting such information in stone in the form of a contract. A contract, whether between a freelancer, full-time employee, or agency, safeguards your interest and ensures that you at not left thrown in at the deep end in the middle of a mission-critical project. So, insist on a contract.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Finding and hiring WordPress experts is no easy task. However, a little guidance and direction can go a long way in charting these territories. With the information shared above, you can proceed confidently to <a href="https://www.uplers.com/hire-wordpress-developers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hire WordPress developers</a> who are a right fit for your organization, deliver to expectations, and are easy on the pocket.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ever since its launch, Python has been an in-demand skill for both developers looking to start a career in programming and for businesses looking to build products. As if it were not already popular, Python was ranked the top programming language as per the trends in the</span><a style="color: #000000;" href="https://statisticstimes.com/tech/top-computer-languages.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">TIOBE and PYPL Index</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, making it the most sought-after skill of the year. This popularity has immensely affected Python contractor rates in 2022. We&#8217;ll walk you through the trends with regard to the average salary for python developers in this article.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">[PS: Excited? Get ready as the upcoming segments of the blog will nudge your head with some good meat to digest.]</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-32362" src="https://www.uplers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/TIOBE-Index-for-Pytho-Developers-Hiring-Trends-to-Watch-Out-300x154.jpg" alt="Trend in Python Programming Language Popularity" width="625" height="321" srcset="https://www.uplers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/TIOBE-Index-for-Pytho-Developers-Hiring-Trends-to-Watch-Out-300x154.jpg 300w, https://www.uplers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/TIOBE-Index-for-Pytho-Developers-Hiring-Trends-to-Watch-Out-768x395.jpg 768w, https://www.uplers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/TIOBE-Index-for-Pytho-Developers-Hiring-Trends-to-Watch-Out-624x321.jpg 624w, https://www.uplers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/TIOBE-Index-for-Pytho-Developers-Hiring-Trends-to-Watch-Out-500x257.jpg 500w, https://www.uplers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/TIOBE-Index-for-Pytho-Developers-Hiring-Trends-to-Watch-Out.jpg 909w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><a style="color: #000000;" href="https://www.daxx.com/blog/development-trends/python-developer-salary-usa" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Source</span></a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">But why are these trends even important, and why should you care? Well, Python is quickly becoming the go-to language for business products, and the demand for Python developers among companies in the US is increasing. The supply, however, is scattered around the world and this introduces an entirely new challenge when it comes to recruiting and compensation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">The trends that we have curated for you are centered around Python developer pay, their demand, their supply, and the best way to recruit them &#8211; having the skill gap, market competition, and higher recruitment costs in mind. They will help you create a smarter, more favorable hiring strategy. That coupled with the recruitment tips we have provided will ensure you put together a high-performing engineering team, fast.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">The hiring landscape is not as straightforward as it used to be a few years ago. Today you can hire full-time developers or part-time contractors, you can hire remotely and have teams located around the globe, or you can just hire a team and outsource the entire project &#8211; there are numerous options.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">This article will answer all the questions you might have about hiring a Python developer &#8211; about python developer salaries, remote hiring, outsourcing projects, reducing recruitment turnaround, and more. So buckle up, and let&#8217;s get started.</span></p>
<h2><span style="color: #000000;"><b>What is Python?</b></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Before we get to Python contractor rates, let&#8217;s take a step back and understand what makes Python so popular.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Python is a general-purpose programming language, which means it can be used to build a wide range of programs and does not have a single specific domain. Anything from BI platforms, CRMs, and OTTs to games, web scrapers, and social media platforms can be built with Python.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike more conventional languages like C++ or popular languages like Java, Python is easier to learn and simpler to code in. This is because Python&#8217;s design philosophy prioritizes code readability. The syntaxes in Python are more readable and very similar to words in the English language (in both spelling and meaning), and this is what makes it easy to learn and use. In fact, in 2017,</span><a style="color: #000000;" href="https://leftronic.com/blog/python-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">4 out of 5</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> developers said Python is their primary language for programming.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">This makes it a popular choice among developers as a career skill, and the speed with which projects can be completed also makes it a popular language for product development among companies. Python is used by some of the largest companies like IBM, Netflix, NASA, Pixar, Intel, Facebook, JP Morgan Chase, and Spotify.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Its popularity among developers and companies is what has made it the number one programming language on the</span><a style="color: #000000;" href="https://statisticstimes.com/tech/top-computer-languages.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">TIOBE and PYPL Index</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, both of which rank languages based on popularity within the community.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">[PS: Not yet half the meat! There is more. Believe me, you&#8217;ll miss out on a lot if you don&#8217;t go down to read the next sections.]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">There are a couple of reasons that make Python popular:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="color: #000000;"><b>Scalability</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; Products built on Python are highly scalable because of the nature of the programming language and its internal features like built-in data structures, dynamic binding, and dynamic typing.</span></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="color: #000000;"><b>In-Built Libraries</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; Python&#8217;s ready-to-use libraries like NumPy and SciPy help developers build programs much faster than other languages.</span></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="color: #000000;"><b>A Wide Developer Community </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; Python has a wide developer community (the second largest among all programming languages) on platforms like Stack Overflow and Github, and this has helped in its growth over the years. The ability to solve problems faced by developers faster through the community is another reason that makes it popular.</span></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="color: #000000;"><b>Simple Syntax </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; As languages have evolved, more importance has been given to ease of use. Traditional languages like C and C++ used more arbitrary syntaxes that took time to memorize. Python, on the other hand, uses more readable syntaxes, which makes it easy to learn and code.</span></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="color: #000000;"><b>Open-Source </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; As an open-source programming language, it is free to use and receives continuous updates and improvements from within the community.</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Python is also the preferred language for building data science and machine learning programs, and since these subsets of AI are booming, Python will continue to be one of the top 3 most popular languages in the years to come.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Hiring freelancers has been a trend for quite some time now. You might think the 5K job openings prove freelancing is the way to go, right? Wait till you learn about the demand for full-time Python developers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">While there is good demand for freelancers, the demand for full-time Python developers is significantly higher. There are over 82K job listings for Python developers on the hiring portal Indeed as of May 2022.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The case is similar on other job portals like Glassdoor, on which there are close to 25k job openings for Python developers as of May 2022.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-32368" src="https://www.uplers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Python-Developers-Job-Openings-in-Glassdoor-as-of-May-2022-1024x527.png" alt="Glassdoor Job Openings for Python Developers as of May 2022" width="625" height="322" srcset="https://www.uplers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Python-Developers-Job-Openings-in-Glassdoor-as-of-May-2022-1024x527.png 1024w, https://www.uplers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Python-Developers-Job-Openings-in-Glassdoor-as-of-May-2022-300x154.png 300w, https://www.uplers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Python-Developers-Job-Openings-in-Glassdoor-as-of-May-2022-768x395.png 768w, https://www.uplers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Python-Developers-Job-Openings-in-Glassdoor-as-of-May-2022-1536x790.png 1536w, https://www.uplers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Python-Developers-Job-Openings-in-Glassdoor-as-of-May-2022-624x321.png 624w, https://www.uplers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Python-Developers-Job-Openings-in-Glassdoor-as-of-May-2022-500x257.png 500w, https://www.uplers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Python-Developers-Job-Openings-in-Glassdoor-as-of-May-2022.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" /></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The demand for Python developers is increasing at a steady pace, and moving into 2022, it is almost as much as that of Java developers (which is a little over</span><a style="color: #000000;" href="https://www.indeed.com/jobs?q=java%20Developer&amp;l=United%20States&amp;vjk=e73026fad9d7e5a8" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">110K</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on Indeed).</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">The key takeaway here is the method of employment that is trending among top companies in 2022. While there still is a demand for freelancers, full-time employment is the clear winner among companies in the US. This is also proving to be a challenge when it comes to hiring Python developers &#8211; there is now a high demand that the existing talent pool cannot fulfill, as you will see further in this article.</span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #000000;"><b>3. Python Contractor Rates in Comparison to Other Top Programming Languages of 2022</b></span></h3>

</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">It&#8217;s evident that companies hiring Python developers are paying competitive and high Python contractor rates in 2022.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The industry that the developer works in also affects the Python coder&#8217;s salary. According to</span><a style="color: #000000;" href="https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/data-analytics/python-developer-salary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Glassdoor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the average salaries given by the top sectors in the U.S in 2021 were as follows:</span></span></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to</span><a style="color: #000000;" href="https://www.altigee.com/magazine/python-developer-salary-where-to-find-great-devs-for-your-project-and-budget" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Altigee</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Python developers are distributed across the globe as follows:</span></span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-32372" src="https://www.uplers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/2022-Geographic-Distribution-of-Python-Developers-1024x887.jpg" alt="2022 Geographic Distribution of Python Developers" width="625" height="541" srcset="https://www.uplers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/2022-Geographic-Distribution-of-Python-Developers-1024x887.jpg 1024w, https://www.uplers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/2022-Geographic-Distribution-of-Python-Developers-300x260.jpg 300w, https://www.uplers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/2022-Geographic-Distribution-of-Python-Developers-768x665.jpg 768w, https://www.uplers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/2022-Geographic-Distribution-of-Python-Developers-1536x1331.jpg 1536w, https://www.uplers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/2022-Geographic-Distribution-of-Python-Developers-624x541.jpg 624w, https://www.uplers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/2022-Geographic-Distribution-of-Python-Developers-500x433.jpg 500w, https://www.uplers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/2022-Geographic-Distribution-of-Python-Developers.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">This indicates a healthy distribution of talent among the US, Europe, Asia, and other continents.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">The fact that India has the second-highest population in terms of skilled Python developers is one reason why top companies in the US are turning to remote hiring of talent from India. A concept that we will cover later in this article.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Based on these four trends, we can safely say that Python developer salaries depend on a couple of factors:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Country (and region)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Experience level</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Position/designation</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Employment type (full-time, contractor, freelancer, remote, so on)</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">With Python contractor rates and the competition to hire talent being the highest in the US, what can you do to acquire skilled developers within a reasonable pay scale? The answer is in the geographic distribution of Python developers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">With the top talent available for lower prices outside the US, why would you look to compete for the same resources within a scarce talent pool and pay unnecessarily higher salaries? There is a smart way to hire talent in 2022, and we&#8217;ll get to it in just a bit.</span></p>
<h2><span style="color: #000000;"><b>The Competition to Hire the Best Python Developers</b></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Businesses are beginning to witness the advantage of using Python for development, and this has led to an increase in the demand for Python developers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Here are some of the top companies (with over 1,000 employees) across the top 5 regions of the world recruiting Python developers on LinkedIn and Indeed:</span></p>

</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">The US has the highest number of job openings for Python developers by far, and it&#8217;s evident that some of the top companies in the world are using Python for their product development needs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">This also solidifies a key point we have been making since the start &#8211; there is a massive demand for Python developers in the US among companies of all sizes and industries. The competition to hire skilled resources is evidently going to increase moving into 2022 as the availability of Python developers in the US begins to wane.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">This brings us to the final piece of the puzzle &#8211; the solution to hiring skilled Python developers in an ever-depleting market.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">[PS: Ready for the breakthrough? The next segment of this blog will detail out the solutions to all the burnout problems with regard to hiring Python contractors.]</span></p>
<h2><span style="color: #000000;"><b>With an Imbalance in Demand &amp; Supply, How Do Companies Hire the Best Talent?</b></span></h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-32359" src="https://www.uplers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Skill-Gap-Effecting-Python-Developers-Pay-in-2022-1024x536.png" alt="Skill Gap Impacting Python Contractor Rates in 2022" width="625" height="327" srcset="https://www.uplers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Skill-Gap-Effecting-Python-Developers-Pay-in-2022-1024x536.png 1024w, https://www.uplers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Skill-Gap-Effecting-Python-Developers-Pay-in-2022-300x157.png 300w, https://www.uplers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Skill-Gap-Effecting-Python-Developers-Pay-in-2022-768x402.png 768w, https://www.uplers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Skill-Gap-Effecting-Python-Developers-Pay-in-2022-624x327.png 624w, https://www.uplers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Skill-Gap-Effecting-Python-Developers-Pay-in-2022-500x262.png 500w, https://www.uplers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Skill-Gap-Effecting-Python-Developers-Pay-in-2022.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">There are two key trends that point toward the imbalance in the demand and supply of Python developers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">First is the demand based on the high Python developer pay scale and job openings. The United States has one of the highest number of job listings for Python developers on Indeed &#8211; 81K job openings. On the flip side, Upwork has only 5K jobs listed. This helps us make two key deductions &#8211; there&#8217;s a huge demand for Python developers in the US, and this demand is largely for full-time employees (as opposed to freelancers).</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The second is the geographic distribution of Python developers. We saw in</span><a style="color: #000000;" href="https://www.altigee.com/magazine/python-developer-salary-where-to-find-great-devs-for-your-project-and-budget" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Altigee</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8216;s report that the Python developer workforce is evenly divided between continents. </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">These two stats give us a key piece of information &#8211; while the demand is high in the US, the distribution of developers is almost evenly spread among the US, Europe, and Asia. So recruiters in the US will have to look towards other countries to fulfill their demand for Python developers. The assumption would be that freelancing is the solution, but it&#8217;s evident that businesses prefer full-time hires over freelancers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">The solution is bringing the two together &#8211; the need for full-time employees and the availability of developers in locations outside the US. For example, India.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">India has the highest pool of python developers outside the US, so that solves the challenge of availability. The average salary of a Python developer in India ranges from $6.5K to $13K per annum, which is considerably lower than the asking rate among developers in the US.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">So a company in the US can get highly skilled developers for much more reasonable Python contractor rates if they choose to hire from a country outside the US, like India. The ready availability of talent also opens up the opportunity to fill positions faster and to also acquire a wide range of skillsets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">But how do you hire a developer in India while operating in the US? It&#8217;s through remote hiring.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">[PS: That&#8217;s a lot of information right?  Have a sip of coffee as we have now almost reached the bottom section of the blog. So, re-energize your mind for the next segment!]</span></p>
<h2><span style="color: #000000;"><b>Remote Hiring to Find the Best Python Developers</b></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Remote hiring can do wonders to overcome the challenge of the skill gap, tackle recruitment costs, and stand out from the hiring competition. </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-32360" src="https://www.uplers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/remote-python-developer-salary-trends-1024x621.jpg" alt="Onboard Best Python Developers With Remote Hiring" width="625" height="379" srcset="https://www.uplers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/remote-python-developer-salary-trends-1024x621.jpg 1024w, https://www.uplers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/remote-python-developer-salary-trends-300x182.jpg 300w, https://www.uplers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/remote-python-developer-salary-trends-768x466.jpg 768w, https://www.uplers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/remote-python-developer-salary-trends-436x265.jpg 436w, https://www.uplers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/remote-python-developer-salary-trends-624x379.jpg 624w, https://www.uplers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/remote-python-developer-salary-trends-500x303.jpg 500w, https://www.uplers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/remote-python-developer-salary-trends.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">With the war of tech talent acquisition intensifying, going for a remote hiring model can only be the ideal savior as it has the potential to bridge the gaps in reaching out to skilled tech professionals and filling open positions. It&#8217;s not a compromise you make by choosing remote hiring, it&#8217;s a smart approach you take to be ahead. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remote hiring works best on a collaborative model where a</span><a style="color: #000000;" href="https://www.uplers.com/hire-python-developers/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">talent sourcing company</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> first finds you the top candidates for a Python development job opening you have after sorting through all applicants who apply. You then interview these shortlisted candidates and select the right one for the job, and the sourcing company handles onboarding and HR support.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">We know what your concern is at this point &#8211; the quality of the hire. If you outsource initial rounds of selection, how can you ensure you&#8217;re getting the best candidates, right?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Quality is managed by the comprehensive screening process that is followed. All candidates are screened through rigorous assessments specifically created for the required post and vetted by top recruiters within the same field. This ensures you get the best talent while also reducing the load of recruitment. Additionally, the remote Python developer salary will be much reasonable for the skill expertise and experience, reducing recruitment costs.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remote hiring lets you break free from geographic barriers that currently exist with hiring full-time Python developers. When you look for full-time developers using the traditional hiring model, you are restricted to local hiring.</span><a style="color: #000000;" href="https://www.uplers.com/hiring-locally/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Local hiring poses some serious challenges</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; it&#8217;s difficult to find the best talent, the recruitment process takes longer and costs more, and so on.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">These drawbacks are eliminated when you have access to a global talent pool. The supply matches the demand, and you can fulfill the position much faster. You also get the added benefit of remote onboarding and support that takes away all the responsibilities of pre and post-hiring activities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">[PS: Finally! You have done it. Now you know the trends of Python contractor rates in 2022 and the ways you can reach out to top skilled talents in this category on a budget without compromising quality. Be wise in your decision! Devise an A-game plan and up your recruitment strategy.]</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Digital ad spending is expected to touch a whopping <a href="https://www.oberlo.in/statistics/digital-ad-spend" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$571.16 <em>billion</em></a> this year, and companies are all geared up to put their money in the instrument they trust the most &#8211; Google Ads.</p>
<p>With a search market share of <a href="https://www.webfx.com/blog/marketing/google-adwords-vs-bing-ads/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">76%</a> and an average conversion rate of 3.75%, Google Ads is an unstoppable force that is putting companies of all shapes and sizes, and across all industries, on the digital map.</p>
<p>However, with this popularity comes a level of saturation as everyone is fighting for the same resources. And here’s where comes the need to bring the big guns out and fight smarter, not harder. In simple words, here’s where you rope in the <a href="https://www.uplers.com/hire-ppc-expert" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google ads experts</a> to gain a competitive edge above the rest.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are on the lookout for Google advertising consultants who can steer your business towards growth, we have just the thing for you. Read on to know everything before hiring Google ads experts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Google Ads vs. SEO: Knowing the Basics</h2>
<p>“Pfft, I don’t need Google ads experts! I have a team of experienced SEO professionals!”</p>
<p>Sounds like a familiar argument? Well, it is not alone!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter" src="https://images.surferseo.art/7a39688f-eed6-4a4b-a60a-752621b7a623.jpeg" alt="Google Ads vs. SEO" width="1200" height="728" /></p>
<p>A lot of people use Google ads and SEO interchangeably, hence the confusion. So before we get into the specifics of hiring Google ads experts, let us first clear the air on how Google Ads are not the same as SEO.</p>
<p>For a start, Google Ads (or pay-per-click advertising) is a service offered by Google. Companies avail it to bid for certain keywords against which the search engine will display your products/services or website.</p>
<p>Accordingly, you will have to pay for every click that your ad attracts, and for this reason, the resulting traffic is known as “paid traffic.”</p>
<p>On the other hand, Search Engine Optimization, or SEO, is a set of activities that will help your website rank on the Search Engine Result Pages (SERPs). It is an indication of the expertise, authoritativeness, and trustworthiness of your website, which earns you unpaid traffic, aka, organic traffic.</p>
<p>If we had to summarise the entire difference between Google Ads and SEO, it would be &#8211; Google Ads gets you paid traffic while SEO attracts organic traffic.</p>
<p>In simple words, for a digital marketing campaign to be truly successful, you will need to pull off a blend of Google ads <em>and</em> SEO. So, hold on dearly to the SEO and Google ads expert to play their respective roles!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Why Should You Look For Google Ads Experts?</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter" src="https://images.surferseo.art/f6ea3713-2248-4e07-be14-55cc901e8902.jpeg" alt="Google Ads Experts" width="1200" height="728" /></p>
<p>In the words of Red Adair, “If you think it’s expensive to hire a professional to do the job, wait until you hire an amateur.” And let’s face it, even if you go with the DIY approach, you are no Google ads specialist, which means that you might end up making frivolous mistakes like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Placing Google Ads conversion tags on every possible page.</li>
<li>Running too many or too few ads.</li>
<li>Geo-targeting Google ads inaccurately (or failing to calibrate it).</li>
<li>Publishing ads on the default Display Network rather than Search Networks.</li>
<li>Using the incorrect keyword match type.</li>
<li>Funnelling traffic to the wrong landing page.</li>
<li>Forgetting to incorporate ad extensions like location, price, callout, etc.</li>
<li>Not having a bidding strategy or coupling smart bidding with the wrong goal.</li>
<li>Using too many keywords and neglecting the negative words.</li>
<li>Failing to test the ad copy.</li>
<li>Neglecting the Call-to-Action (CTA) button.</li>
</ul>
<p>Seeing as Google Ads cost you actual money or that Google could permanently ban you for abusing its policies, there is a lot at stake and virtually no room for error.</p>
<p>And in this situation, you need to do what Red Adair asks you to &#8211; trust a professional. So, if it isn’t clear enough already, here’s why you should seek <a href="https://www.uplers.com/blog/what-you-need-to-know-before-you-hire-ppc-expert-remotely/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PPC experts</a> or Google ads expert:</p>

<h2>8 Things You Need to Know Before Hiring Google Ads Experts</h2>
<p>Now that you have made the smarter decision to hire Google ads experts, let’s talk about what you need to know before proceeding on this quest. Some key questions that will come your way include:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h3>Do You Need a Freelancer or an Agency?</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter" src="https://images.surferseo.art/d22d66a3-56b2-48cb-b73e-301cbbf08fd6.jpeg" alt="Google Ads Agency Vs. Freelancer" width="1200" height="628" /></li>
</ol>
<p>The answer to this question primarily depends on your business, its size, the industry, your spending power, and what you wish to achieve. A PPC freelancer would be a better alternative to the DIY approach and can be cost-effective.</p>
<p>Some Google ads experts also possess fringe skills that can benefit your business. However, skill and availability can be an issue. On the other hand, agencies draw from their collective expertise but also cost accordingly. So, weigh out your options while making this choice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<h3>Should You Care About Certification?<img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-32245 size-large" src="https://www.uplers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Are-certifications-important-1-1024x536.jpg" alt="Google Ads Certification" width="625" height="327" srcset="https://www.uplers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Are-certifications-important-1-1024x536.jpg 1024w, https://www.uplers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Are-certifications-important-1-300x157.jpg 300w, https://www.uplers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Are-certifications-important-1-768x402.jpg 768w, https://www.uplers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Are-certifications-important-1-624x327.jpg 624w, https://www.uplers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Are-certifications-important-1-500x262.jpg 500w, https://www.uplers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Are-certifications-important-1.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" /></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Google runs six Google Ads certification programs, namely, Google Ads Search, Google Ads Display, Google Ads Video, Shopping Ads, Google Ads Apps, and Google Ads Measurements. Once accredited, it is a testament to the individual’s knowledge and proficiency in Google ads.</p>
<p>And this certification could be the fine line separating genuine Google ads expert from those who just want to make a quick buck. That’s not to say that those without the certification are bogus Google advertising consultants, but the certification sure does bring a good amount of weight to someone claiming to be an “expert.”</p>
<p>It would also help if they were a Google Partner, as it is a formal recognition of their abilities to maximise campaign success, drive growth, and display expertise.</p>
<p>Once again, it is not mandatory, but it sure does help in making a better choice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<h3>What Kind of Campaigns Do You Wish to Run?</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter" src="https://images.surferseo.art/b1ef0062-0237-44f5-bdbd-718afdf5811c.jpeg" alt="Google Adwords Campaigns" width="2036" height="728" /></li>
</ol>
<p>As seen above, Google ads specialist have their respective fields of expertise in different segments of Google ads management. Against this backdrop, it would help to have greater clarity on what <em>you</em> want so that you can better align it with the talent available.</p>
<p>For instance, you might want to clean up your act with a campaign audit. Or you could be looking for turnkey solutions for active campaign ads management. Or you only need assistance with bidding &#8211; the list goes on.</p>
<p>Begin with understanding your organisational goals first and selecting the key skill set accordingly. You can also frame this homework in the form of a question and ask the Google ads consultant for advice on meeting the business objectives.</p>
<p>Their answer may help you figure out if you have found the right fit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<h3>Have They Worked in Your Industry?</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter" src="https://images.surferseo.art/35c94787-4629-45c6-af85-e1e8944b8685.jpeg" alt="Google adwords expert experience" width="1200" height="728" /></p>
<p>Spoiler alert, you can overlook their certifications and accreditation if the Google ads experts can display their worth through case studies and portfolios (more on this later). However, what really matters is that the Google adwords expert possess demonstrable experience in your industrial sector.</p>
<p>Their foresight would prove to be instrumental in the success of your campaign as the Google Ads manager will have a detailed understanding of the industry and an innate understanding of the target audience right from day one.</p>
<p>Such experiential insights will help you gain value from day one rather than spending the initial few days explaining all that there is in your sector.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>
<h3>Would They be Willing to Share Their Portfolio?</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter" src="https://images.surferseo.art/1cd7d9a3-a13a-4762-afce-853e09652707.jpeg" alt="Google Ad experts portfolio" width="1200" height="728" /></p>
<p>Speaking of expertise and experience, the best way to judge their talents would be through their portfolio.</p>
<p>Ideally, you should have done a thorough background check on the Google ads expert before even considering them. That being said, if you are to reach a point where you haven’t done so and are already in talks with them, then now would be a great time to ask for portfolios and case studies.</p>
<p>Portfolios typically contain project names, client names, and case studies, and are often seen as a sign of professionalism. All in all, you can go through it to understand their process and visualise tangible results enjoyed by customers who hired the said Google advertising expert. It also gives an overview of how long they have been in business.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>
<h3>How Much Are You Willing to Pay?</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Budget is a tricky subject. And when it comes to PPC advertising, you will have to factor in the ad spend as well as the cost of engaging the Google ads expert.</p>
<p>Google AdWords Expert may charge you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Per campaign.</li>
<li>Based on the results.</li>
<li>Proportionate to the time.</li>
<li>A flat-rate fee, aka retainer.</li>
</ul>
<p>Work out your budget accordingly to get the complete picture of the financial liability. You will also have to balance the cost with the services that you are expecting at the said price point.</p>
<p>It would be easier if you could classify these services as “Absolute Necessity” and “Nice-to-Have” so that you can maintain some flexibility.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="7">
<li>
<h3>How Do You Plan on Measuring Progress?</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter" src="https://images.surferseo.art/2a538a4f-5ef3-424e-8076-4ab4c31d9e79.jpeg" alt="Google Adwords KPI" width="1200" height="628" /></p>
<p>Considering how much you would be investing in the Google ads campaign, you would naturally wish to see tangible results. And to quantify and measure these metrics, you might have envisioned certain Key Performance Indicators (or KPIs), the most common ones being:</p>
<ul>
<li>RoAS &#8211; Return on Ad Spend</li>
<li>CPA &#8211; Cost Per Acquisition (aka Cost Per Conversion)</li>
<li>CTR &#8211; Click-Through Rates</li>
<li>Conversion Rate</li>
<li>Number of clicks</li>
<li>Number of impressions</li>
<li>Quality Score</li>
</ul>
<p>You might also have to decide how often you wish to be updated and what would be the best format to present these findings.</p>
<p>Setting such clear expectations right from the start ensures that the Google ads consultant can deliver accordingly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="8">
<li>
<h3>What Happens After the Contract Ends?</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>While kicking off a Google ads campaign under the tutelage of an expert may seem thrilling, you need to have an end goal in mind. And no, we are not talking about results as they would naturally be in the spotlight. We are talking about having an offboarding strategy.</p>
<p>Ensure that you maintain a sufficient buffer period for a smooth handover. Also, you will also have to take back charge of all your accounts and campaigns. Similarly, any proprietary data must also be retained so that you can run, manage, or analyze campaigns autonomously.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter" src="https://images.surferseo.art/33f2d00a-cd97-45df-bcb5-ef8faa333a06.jpeg" alt="find the right PPC Experts" width="2160" height="2160" /></p>
<h2>How to find the right Pay Per Click Expert for your business?</h2>
<p>Hiring PPC experts may surely seem like the solution to your advertising needs, but finding a PPC expert who meets all your requirements is one of the biggest challenges you’ll face as a hiring manager.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Without further ado let us get right into how you can find a PPC advertising expert:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h3>Do your research</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>You’ll come across a lot of freelancers who will be willing to work as independent PPC consultant for your organization. However, you’ll have to do good research to find legitimate candidates who are actually good at what they claim.</p>
<p>Try looking for certificates and their past work which will demonstrate and support their success story. Based on their past work, you’ll be able to identify their work quality in digital marketing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Look for any certifications such as Google Ads certifications, this will help you understand the technical expertise level of the individual</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Take some time to research different providers and read online reviews before making a decision. This will help you narrow down your options and find a provider that’s a good fit for your business.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>2. Consider your needs</h3>
<p>Whether you want to drive traffic and conversions or you want to grow your brand’s digital presence- PPC is one effective way to achieve your goals.</p>
<p>But before you start your hunt for a PPC advertising expert, you’ll need to be clear of your own goals.</p>
<p>Think about what you need from a PPC advertising expert:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do you need help with keyword research?</li>
<li>Do you need help with strategizing?</li>
<li>Or do you need someone to manage your entire campaign from start to finish?</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you know what you need, you can start looking for providers that offer those services.</p>
<p>When you have a clear understanding of your expectations from the candidate the more accurately they’ll be able to form their paid marketing strategies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>3. Compare your options</h3>
<p>You don’t want to go ahead and finalize the first professional that you come across.</p>
<p>Make sure you get in touch with different Google AdWords specialists to get an idea of distinctive profiles and what they bring to the table for you.</p>
<p>Pricing will vary depending on the provider and the services you need. So it’s important to compare pricing before making a decision.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that the cheapest option isn’t always the best, and be sure to factor in quality when considering price, as this is rather an investment than an expense.</p>
<p>Ask for any hidden costs as you’ll want to avoid any last minute unpleasant surprises.</p>
<p>You can get in touch with various AdWords specialists and compare their skills and pricing for a better judgment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>4. Hire a talent outsourcing company</h3>
<p>One of the best ways to hire the best PPC campaign expert is by associating with a talent outsourcing company like Uplers.</p>
<p>These companies will help you get in touch with some of the best talents in the industry who have already qualified rounds of initial screening and technical assessment.</p>
<p>This way, you don’t have to do the hard work of finding candidates, conducting background checks or analyzing their technical skills. You’ll already be in touch with pre-vetted candidates.</p>
<p>All you need to do is conduct a final round of interview to assess whether they’re the right choice for your organization and then make the final call accordingly.</p>
<p>You’ll have someone who will be a part of your marketing team and works in-house for you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>5.  Outsource PPC Experts</h3>
<p>There are a lot of agencies that provide PPC services. These agencies provide a plethora of digital marketing services.</p>
<p>However, these agencies can be very expensive and you won’t have an in-house employee working exclusively for your business needs.</p>

<h2>Tips to hire the right PPC experts</h2>
<p>Once you’ve decided that you want to go ahead with PPC services, there are a few things that you need to keep in mind before you go ahead and take the final call.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h3>Check if they are data and analytics oriented</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>A good PPC expert will be able to improve ROI by knowing about your target audience and developing high-yield campaigns.</p>
<p>They will be well versed with tools to measure essential PPC campaigns and Google ads metrics and will actively share data and results with you.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<h3>Focuses on local search</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Local search is one of the best ways to reach a local community by targeting location-specific search queries, especially for businesses that have physical stores and do not ship to other countries or states.</p>
<p>Especially if you’re an online or even a brick and mortar business that serves in a specific local area then a local search strategy can benefit you immensely.</p>
<p>Out of <a href="https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/marketing-strategies/search/mobile-near-me-searches/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">82% of smartphone users</a> who use their phones to find businesses near them, 72% of those lead to an in-store visit on the same day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<h3>They take mobile optimization seriously</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>As <a href="https://www.smallbizgenius.net/by-the-numbers/ppc-stats/#gref" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">half of the paid media clicks</a> are made from smartphones, it has become increasingly important to pay attention to designing PPC ads for devices of all sizes.</p>
<p>The PPC experts you hire should be able to provide you with mobile optimised copy and display ads.</p>
<p>You can also pick their brain on various ways you can create a mobile optimized paid search and other search engine marketing campaigns.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<h3>Unmatchable keyword research</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The right PPC experts words with commercial intent.</p>
<p>Keywords like ‘Buy refrigerator’ or ‘ hire web developer’ show the user’s intent to buy.</p>

<h2>Why hiring the right PPC experts is crucial for your business?</h2>
<p>There are a lot of self-claimed PPC experts out there that offer pay-per-click (paid search) services.</p>
<p>However, not all of them are created equal. If you want to make sure that your PPC (search engine marketing) campaign is successful, you need to hire the right expert.</p>
<p>Here are some of the mistakes that you should avoid when hiring a PPC campaigns expert:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h3>Hiring someone who is not certified</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>There are a lot of people who claim to be paid search experts, but not all of them are certified.</p>
<p>If you want to make sure that you are hiring the right person, you should only consider those who are certified by Google ads.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<h3>Not checking the candidate’s credentials</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>When you are looking for PPC experts, you should also take the time to check their credentials.</p>
<p>This will give you an idea of the kind of experience they have in managing PPC campaigns.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<h3>Failing to set a budget</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>One of the most common mistakes that businesses make when hiring PPC experts is failing to set a budget.</p>
<p>Before you start looking for a PPC marketing expert you need to determine how much you are willing to spend on a campaign.</p>
<p>This will help you narrow down your options and find an Google AdWords specialist who fits your budget</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<h3>Not asking for references</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Another mistake that you should avoid is not asking for references.</p>
<p>You should always ask for references from previous clients. This will help you get an idea of the quality of work that the individual can provide.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>
<h3>Hiring someone who is not experienced</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>When it comes to paid search marketing, experience is crucial.</p>
<p>You should avoid hiring someone who is not experienced in managing paid search campaigns.</p>
<p>This is because they will not be able to provide you with the results that you are looking for.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>
<h3>Not doing your research</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Finally, you should also make sure that you do your research before hiring a search engine marketing expert.</p>
<p>This means that you need to read reviews and compare different candidates. This will help you make a mindful decision.</p>

<h2>Signs that you have hired the right candidate for PPC experts</h2>
<p>Once you’ve come across a candidate who ticks all the boxes for you, it&#8217;s time to see them in action.</p>
<p>We will talk about some of the telltale signs that indicate that you were lucky enough to find the perfect Google AdWords specialist for your business!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h3>They give it all to get the best conversion rate</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>You can’t optimize your paid keywords unless you have a great PPC marketing expert who will work with everyone from ads, landing pages and website design departments.</p>
<p>That way when it comes time for optimisation they are well-equipped to convert visitors into conversions at the highest possible rate!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<h3>They’re result-oriented</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>You may have heard that the success of your PPC campaign isn&#8217;t determined by how much money you spend on it, but by who manages the account.</p>
<p>Look for a Pay per click expert who will always put out high-quality work and be driven towards reaching goals.</p>
<p>This person might even require their compensation structure to tie to the results in order to maintain focus during tough times or when working with new clients!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<h3>Their strategies are data-driven</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Innovative PPC managers and firms will always be at the forefront of innovation.</p>
<p>They won&#8217;t just help you improve conversion rates, but advocate for advanced analytics tracking in order to turn data into insights that can then lead directly towards actionable improvements.</p>

<h2>Why hire remotely for PPC experts?</h2>
<p>There are many reasons to consider hiring remotely for a pay-per-click expert. Here are some key benefits:</p>
<h3>Cost savings</h3>
<p>You can save on costs associated with traditional office space and equipment when you hire remotely. All a great expert needs is a sturdy internet connection and an innovative mind.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Increased flexibility</h3>
<p>Remote workers can often be more flexible with their schedules, which can be a boon for businesses that operate on a 24/7 basis or have employees in different time zones. Many pay per click and google ads experts need an undisturbed space to work on new strategies, thus allowing them to work remotely from their comfort zone promises great strategies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Access to a global talent pool</h3>
<p>When you open up your hiring to remote workers, you can tap into a much larger pool of talent because you’re not limited by any geographical boundaries.</p>
<p>This is especially helpful if you&#8217;re looking for niche skills or expertise, the same stands true when hiring PPC experts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Increased productivity</h3>
<p>Studies have shown that remote workers are often more productive than their office-based counterparts.</p>
<p>This means that you can get much more work done without your employees having to compromise on their work-life balance. Given that paid search experts need to be on the spike of productivity, hiring remotely is a big step towards that.</p>

<h2>Frequently Answered Questions (FAQs)</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<h3>What is PPC?</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>PPC is short for pay-per-click, a model of internet marketing in which advertisers display ads on their website and only pay when a user actually clicks on the ad. This makes it a very cost-effective way to market your product or service online since you only pay when you get results.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<h3>Should I hire dedicated PPC experts or outsource from an agency?</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>There is no easy answer to this question, as it depends on a number of factors such as your budget, your level of expertise, and your goals. If you have the budget, hiring a dedicated pay-per-click expert can be a good investment, as they will be able to help you maximize your results and work exclusively for your business needs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<h3>How do I create a solid PPC strategy?</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Creating a solid PPC strategy involves understanding your goals, researching your target market, and selecting the right keywords. It is also important to create compelling ads and landing pages that will encourage users to click through to your website. Finally, you need to track your results and make adjustments to your campaign as needed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>

</li>
</ol>
<p>Hiring PPC experts comes with multiple benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>You don&#8217;t have the time to manage your own campaign</li>

<li>You&#8217;re not getting the results you want from your current campaign</li>
<li>Your budget is limited</li>
<li>You need help with keyword research</li>
<li>You want to improve your quality score</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>When you&#8217;re looking to hire a PPC consultant, there are a few key things to keep in mind. Firstly, you want to make sure that the person you&#8217;re hiring is an expert in the field.</p>
<p>There are a lot of people who claim to be experts, but they don&#8217;t have the experience or knowledge to back it up.</p>
<p>Secondly, you want to make sure that the person you&#8217;re hiring is someone you can trust. This is especially important if you&#8217;re going to be working with them on an ongoing basis.</p>
<p>Furthermore, hiring a remote paid search consultant or a Google AdWords consultant is one of the best ways you can expand your team. It&#8217;s often more cost-effective than hiring someone locally. This is because you don&#8217;t have to pay for their travel expenses or their accommodation.</p>
<p>Secondly, it can be easier to find a good fit when you&#8217;re looking for a remote worker. This is because you have a larger pool of workers to choose from.</p>
<p>Finally, it can be more convenient to work with a remote worker. This is because you can often arrange for them to work around your schedule and you don&#8217;t have to worry about meeting them in person.</p>

<h2><span style="color: #000000;"><b>#1: Core Java Fundamentals &#8211; Primary Skill Set for Java Developers</b></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Let’s start with the fundamentals of Java!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Core Java developer skills revolve around the most basic skills one needs to possess to qualify as a Java developer. Seeing as these are the core tenets of Java, candidates need to have a command of these basics to illustrate that they have a clear understanding of Java development. Typically, these Java developer skills include:</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-31762" src="https://www.uplers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Core-Java-Developer-Skills-to-Screen-1024x536.jpg" alt="Core Java Developer Skills | Uplers" width="625" height="327" srcset="https://www.uplers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Core-Java-Developer-Skills-to-Screen-1024x536.jpg 1024w, https://www.uplers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Core-Java-Developer-Skills-to-Screen-300x157.jpg 300w, https://www.uplers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Core-Java-Developer-Skills-to-Screen-768x402.jpg 768w, https://www.uplers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Core-Java-Developer-Skills-to-Screen-624x327.jpg 624w, https://www.uplers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Core-Java-Developer-Skills-to-Screen-500x262.jpg 500w, https://www.uplers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Core-Java-Developer-Skills-to-Screen.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" /></p>
<h3 style="text-align: left; padding-left: 40px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><b>A. <span style="color: #000000;">OOP Concepts</span></b></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">OOP, or Object-Oriented Programming, is the guiding principle of programming in Java. It introduces classes and object-style coding by coupling data and functions together in order to enhance code modularity, efficiency, safety, and stability. Following are a few defining characteristics of OOP:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Abstraction only displays the relevant data and hides the complexities from the user.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Inheritance is a mechanism that allows a child class to acquire some properties or attributes of a parent or superclass.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Polymorphism allows the use of a single interface irrespective of the underlying forms, be it data types or classes. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Encapsulation involves binding data with the code that manipulates it and shielding it from external manipulation.</span></span></li>
</ul>
<h3 style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><b>B. Interface</b></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">The Java interface is a collection of abstract methods. It also contains constants, static methods, default methods, and nested types. Having these Java developer basic skills will help the programmer to containerize the code and enable smoother operations with software development.</span></p>
<h3 style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><b>C. Serialization/Deserialization</b></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Serialization relates to converting an object into a sequence of bytes. On the other hand, deserialization allows the recreation of an object from a byte stream. The former is primarily used in Hibernate, JPA, RMI, JMS, and EJB technologies.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><b>(Note: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The above three are the core fundamentals that are the primary skills for java developers to know. There might be more core java concepts but mostly these are the vitals that your next java developer hire should have proper hands-on expertise in.)</span></span></p>
<h2><span style="color: #000000;"><b>#2: Java Web Technologies &#8211; Knowing the Vitals of Web Application Development with Java!</b></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">If you are looking to fill a position with multi-tier skills in the field of web application development and building software solutions, then Java shall form a mission-critical component of your company’s tech stack. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Java web technologies equip developers with the skill and expertise to build rich, engaging, and dynamic web applications. As such, you must seek these essential Java developer skills amongst the prospects &#8211; be it front-end, back-end, or full-stack.</span></p>

<h2><span style="color: #000000;"><b>#4: System Design and Architecture &#8211; A Pro Java Developer Skill Set</b></span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">System design and architecture form the pillar of any application &#8211; whether you are looking to develop software or a webpage or more. While developers would draw from their Java development experience</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">and problem-solving abilities on a case-to-case basis, the working knowledge of Java design patterns would certainly lend a hand in devising appropriate solutions. Design patterns are standardized and proven solutions to frequently occurring problems. They can be broadly classified as:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="color: #000000;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Creational Design Patterns</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which typically include Singleton pattern, Factory pattern, Abstract Factory pattern, Builder pattern, and Prototype pattern.</span></span></li>

<h2><span style="color: #000000;"><b>#8: SOLID Principles: Knowing the Core Concept &amp; Its Uses</b></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">As an OOP language, Java development must adhere to the SOLID principles. SOLID is an acronym for five distinct class-design principles that point toward what do Java developers need to know which are:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="color: #000000;"><b>Single Responsibility</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Every class should be responsible for a corresponding unit part or functionality in the system.</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-32460" src="https://www.uplers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Single-Responsibility-1024x645.png" alt="SOLID Principles to be Known by Developer of Java | Hiring Tips - Uplers" width="625" height="394" srcset="https://www.uplers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Single-Responsibility-1024x645.png 1024w, https://www.uplers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Single-Responsibility-300x189.png 300w, https://www.uplers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Single-Responsibility-768x484.png 768w, https://www.uplers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Single-Responsibility-624x393.png 624w, https://www.uplers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Single-Responsibility-500x315.png 500w, https://www.uplers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Single-Responsibility.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" /></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #000000;"><b>Open/Closed</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Software components must be open to expansion but closed to modification.</span></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;"><b>Liskov Substitution: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Objects belonging to a superclass should be replaceable by the objects within its subclasses without breaking the system.</span></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;"><b>Interface Segregation</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Larger interfaces must be split into smaller ones so that implementing classes only have to function with methods concerning them.</span></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;"><b>Dependency Inversion</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: The decoupling of software modules should be such that high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both entities should only depend on abstraction.</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">SOLID ensures that the solution is modular, easy to understand, debug, refactor, and maintain. It saves the time and effort put into the development and maintenance of the code without compromising its quality. In other words, it is a sign of a reliable Java developer.</span></p>
<h2><span style="color: #000000;"><b>#9: JVM Internals: Advanced Java Skills on How Things Work</b></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">If you have been in the field of recruitment for long, you know that you are expected to know the ins and outs of hiring, onboarding, and catering to the employees’/candidates’ needs. The same goes for Java developers, they need to know about the heart of Java &#8211; the Java Virtual Machine.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Java applications run in the Java Runtime Environment (JRE), and the Java Virtual Machine (aka JVM) is the backbone of JRE. It analyzes and executes the Java bytecode. Most importantly, it grants Java applications the WORA &#8211; Write Once, Run Anywhere &#8211; quality, which makes it platform-independent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">While it is not essential for a developer of Java to know about the functioning of the JVM, it definitely helps if they possess this skill. After all, knowing all about the JVM, its parts, and how they function can help them write high-performing, robust codes. In other words, it is a sign that they are a cut above the rest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">You can either conduct a Java proficiency test or assess the Java developer’s skills by asking questions related to Just-in-Time (JIT) compilation, multithreading, class loading, JVM options, collector, garbage collection, race conditions, concurrency handling, reflection, delegation, performance bottlenecks, execution models, memory management, compile-time and runtime errors, and more.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">While most of the Java developer skills discussed so far have been technical in nature, a well-rounded Java developer must also have the following soft skills:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #000000;"><b>Communication</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Java developers will have to work with other stakeholders from different walks of life. Hence, they should have the communication abilities to articulate their thoughts and convey technical or non-technical information in a simple manner.</span></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;"><b>Comprehension</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: The Java developer will have to understand your requirements and build accordingly. As such, they will have to </span><a style="color: #000000;" href="https://www.uplers.com/blog/core-communication-skills-to-be-screened-when-looking-for-java-developers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">leverage active listening</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to truly deliver to expectations.</span></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;"><b>Teamwork</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Java developers will have to work with others &#8211; within or outside the team. Accordingly, they should have a team spirit that allows them to work with others frictionlessly.</span></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;"><b>Time management</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: A developer is always working against the clock. However, with effective time management and organization, a developer can make efficient use of their time to honor deadlines.</span></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;"><b>Creativity</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Whether it is problem-solving or thinking outside the box, developers will require some amount of creativity to overcome any issues that may crop up during the SDLC.</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">These soft skills for Java developers will shed light on whether the developer is the right fit for the job or for your organization</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Of course, you can be as picky about it as you want.</span></span></p>
<h2><span style="color: #000000;"><b>Ready to Make the Right Pick?</b></span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Given the number of variables involved, hiring a Java developer can seem like an overwhelming and tiresome process.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>AngularJS developers are experience JavaScript programmers that have a thorough understanding of theoretical angular software engineering. Thus, there are multiple angular developer skills that one needs to be a successful angular developer.</p>
<p>With Angular Java coding, AngularJS engineers specialize in creating Single Page Applications (SPAs). They create everything that a user sees and hears on a website.</p>
<p>AngularJS, unlike some other JavaScript frameworks, requires developers to follow the &#8220;Angular&#8221; approach, which is a set of principles and practices that allow developers to get the most out of the framework and create powerful, efficient web applications.</p>
<p>This necessitates engineers knowing AngularJS inside and out rather than merely being a great JavaScript coder.</p>
<p>As a result, the demand for Angular developers is always high.</p>
<p>When you&#8217;re seeking an expert AngularJS developer, putting out a generic JavaScript developer job ad will bring in a lot of applications from people who are good at JavaScript but don&#8217;t know anything about AngularJS.</p>
<p>This article will offer you a sample AngularJS developer job description that will assist you in creating a flawless job ad and ensuring that you find and employ the right person for the position.</p>

<h2>Here are the essential Angular developer skills that you need to look for</h2>
<p>There are various soft skills and hard skills that you need to look for in the candidate. We have laid down some of the most essential Angular developer skills that make a candidate worth it.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-31622 size-large" src="https://www.uplers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/AngularJs-Developers-Skills-1024x621.jpg" alt="AngularJs Developers Skills" width="625" height="379" srcset="https://www.uplers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/AngularJs-Developers-Skills-1024x621.jpg 1024w, https://www.uplers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/AngularJs-Developers-Skills-300x182.jpg 300w, https://www.uplers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/AngularJs-Developers-Skills-768x466.jpg 768w, https://www.uplers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/AngularJs-Developers-Skills-436x265.jpg 436w, https://www.uplers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/AngularJs-Developers-Skills-624x379.jpg 624w, https://www.uplers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/AngularJs-Developers-Skills-500x303.jpg 500w, https://www.uplers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/AngularJs-Developers-Skills.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" /></p>
<h3>1. Npm</h3>
<p>npm is the primary tool used to install, discover, publish and develop thousands of client-side node programs.</p>
<p>The entirety of this popular JavaScript framework can be found in multiple modules across different projects.</p>
<p>When you hire someone with sound knowledge of Npm, they will be able to cater to the updates and changes as your application grows.</p>
<p>The Angular developer you hire will be able to install these optional modules using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Npm_(software)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NPM (Node Package Manager)</a></p>
<h3>2. HTML and CSS</h3>
<p>You may be wondering what it takes to create a fully-functional and beautiful application. Well, there&#8217;s nothing basic about Angular!</p>
<p>Knowing HTML and CSS is one of the most important Angular developer skills.</p>
<p>Angular provides the building blocks that allow the developer to build fast and functional apps. This can be made possible if the developer knows how to render these apps in a browser by working on HTML along with CSS.</p>
<p>HTML and CSS are one of the essential front end developer skills. A knowledgeable developer will be able to tweak things to provide you with a customized experience to deliver exactly what you’re looking for.</p>
<h3>3. Angular CLI</h3>
<p>One of the main Angular developer responsibilities is to create new projects using best practices and templates. Angular CLI is one skill that enables that!</p>
<p>It also simplifies code with its preconfigured configs, ensuring your app is up-to-date in no time! This makes it one of the most essential Angular developer skills.</p>
<p>Alongside these features, there are other advantages like reduced development costs. This is perfect if you’re a small business that wants its work done faster without having to hire multiple developers to perform any extra customization.</p>
<h3>4. Git</h3>
<p>Git is a powerful tool that you can use to keep track of your project changes.</p>
<p>It will also notify if something has been deleted or modified in the code, giving peace of mind while working on complex projects with many people collaborating remotely over email threads.</p>
<p>The best part? You don&#8217;t need any extra software &#8211; your developer will just install what&#8217;s offered through their website (and yes it includes source control).</p>
<p>Git is the best way to work with any application by using source control. Git is one of the most important Angular developer skills which helps in building new features or coding techniques.</p>
<p>With GIT, it is easy to return if something goes wrong&#8211;using Git will give all your crazy ideas some steam while still keeping everything working properly so there are no worries about losing progress.</p>
<h3>5. Testing and Debugging</h3>
<p>Developers must be able to find and fix errors for their apps, websites or software products to run smoothly.</p>
<p>One of the main Angular Developer skills is a deep understanding of how programming works as well as being skilled at reading through other people&#8217;s codes with pinpoint accuracy.</p>
<p>This way, your developer will be able to identify any problem areas before those issues become widespread.</p>
<p>A lot of times, Angular front end developers who are not very proficient with testing and debugging end up trying unsuccessfully to solve one issue after another which creates an even bigger mess!</p>
<p>There are a variety of techniques for testing that one can utilize. The functional test verifies whether or not your product meets all requirements and specifications listed in the development document.</p>
<p>This is useful when you&#8217;re trying to figure out if there&#8217;s something wrong with one small part but don&#8217;t know how exactly else to get started.</p>
<h3>6. RxJS</h3>
<p>When designing an app, one crucial Angular developer skill is to think about how to handle the data.</p>
<p>The library <a href="https://rxjs.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RxJS</a> offers a reactive stream that can be found in many modern frameworks, such as Angular.</p>
<p>RxJS is ideal to use where you need an asynchronous workflow but don&#8217;t want your code to become cluttered by all its detailed work behind the scenes.</p>
<h3>7. Responsive design</h3>
<p>One of the main Angular developer skills is a good understanding of responsive design.</p>
<p>The digital age has been an exciting time for developers who work with web technologies.</p>
<p>New devices such as tablets and smartphones require apps to be designed so they can interface properly while also rendering correctly on different screen sizes.</p>
<p>The right Angular programmer will be able to design a responsive website. They will ensure that your business reaches all audiences.</p>
<p>A responsive design will ensure a seamless browsing experience regardless of the device.</p>
<h2>To sum it up</h2>
<p>Hiring an Angular front end developer who fits perfectly with your organizational goals and responsibilities can be challenging. As there are a lot of <a href="https://www.uplers.com/blog/things-to-know-before-hiring-angular-developers/?utm_source=From_Blogs&amp;utm_medium=UTM_FBlog&amp;utm_campaign=Angular+promotions&amp;utm_id=FromBlogs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">things you should know before hiring angular developers</a>.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With emerging technologies, ever-changing working styles, and post Covid-19 accelerated dynamism, businesses have dramatically changed the way they source and hire talents.</p>
<p>Today, traditional workplace and age-old hiring methods are fading away, and organizations are quick to grasp this new model efficiently and effectively.</p>
<p>Businesses are now looking for new skills, talent diversity, and geographical inclusions more than the in-person requirement or native-inclination candidate profiles. The same stands true for <a href="https://www.uplers.com/hire-seo-expert/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hiring SEO specialists</a> remotely.</p>
<p>Thus, these factors are more important than ever.</p>
<p>As per the statistics of <a href="https://business.linkedin.com/talent-solutions/emerging-jobs-report#all" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LinkedIn&#8217;s analysis of work trends in 15 countries</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Most of the tech-demand jobs for 2021 and the present can all be done remotely</li>
<li>The demand for new tech-side jobs is on the rise. 150% increase in the next five years.</li>
</ul>
<p>Looking at the report of the <a href="https://www.weforum.org/reports/the-future-of-jobs-report-2020/digest" target="_blank" rel="noopener">World Economic Forum</a></p>
<ul>
<li>More than 80% of employers plan to expand their business through remote working.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this blog, we will discuss the urgency, significance, and procedure of hiring SEO specialists remotely. Keep reading!</p>
<h2></h2>
<h2>What do these Remote Hiring statistics suggest?</h2>
<p>Hiring managers and HR heads must rethink their hiring process to win this war.</p>
<p>Moving with traditional recruiting and talent development will hinder the eventual progression of the business.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s talk about some numbers, as per <a href="https://weworkremotely.com/blog-categories/state-of-the-remote-work-reports" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Buffer&#8217;s The State of Remote Work 2021 report</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>More than 90% of the employees have agreed that they would like to work remotely for the rest of their career cycle.</li>
<li>95% agreed to encourage their friends and colleagues to choose remote jobs over traditional workplace jobs.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>And, looking at the hiring manager&#8217;s perspective, as per the study conducted:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>More than 60% of the US companies are now interested in hiring remote talents.</li>
<li>More than 35% of the hiring managers agree that there&#8217;s 168% growth in work completion effectiveness after hiring flexible talent.</li>
<li>Hiring managers now look for dedicated remote talents 55% more aggressively than hiring from locals.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please think of this as advice; when you are complacent about the changing structure of the business, it will cost you in terms of your competitors.</p>
<p>Since many still think that it&#8217;s the post-covid phase where remote working culture is on the rise, and as the situation will subside, the workplace culture will be reinstated.</p>
<p>Here are some statistics that show that Covid-19 only accelerated the process of remote working.</p>

<h2>How hiring global talent can benefit your business?</h2>
<h3>Variety of talent pool</h3>
<p>When you open your doors for global hire, you not only add diversity to the workforce but also expand the breadth of experience, giving greater mobility.</p>
<p>International hiring enables the organization to be more inclusive of different cultures. When businesses become more collective in creating a large talent pool, they effectively increase productivity.</p>
<p>Companies that hire dedicated resources from the international market are more likely to adapt to many multi-forum strategies.</p>
<h3>Relax financially</h3>
<p>This applies significantly to tech and digital hiring.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s say you are a digital marketing company and in need of an SEO specialist who is an expert from the SEO industry. Why not hire from India?</p>
<p>India is a place that houses many well-versed, knowledgeable, and linguistically-skilled SEO specialists.</p>
<p>Look around you; many tech giants&#8217; CEOs are Indians. If you are thinking otherwise, it&#8217;s time to rethink your hiring strategy and demographics again.</p>
<p>When you hire pre-vetted talents from India, you save 30% on salary without compromising the quality.</p>
<h3>Reduce stress</h3>
<p>You are looking to hire an SEO specialist. Someone who is an expert in the digital marketing field.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s essential to ask the right questions to ensure you&#8217;re hiring the best SEO specialist for the job.</p>

What should a full stack java developer know? How to evaluate a full stack resume and its competency when hiring a java developer?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have these questions been bothering you? If you’re an IT recruiter looking to </span><a href="https://www.uplers.com/hire-java-developers/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">hire a java developer</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that meets all your requirements, this quest may seem never-ending to you. You must’ve come across a lot of full stack java developer resumes but sadly, nothing seems to stand out.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-31297" src="https://www.uplers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/difficult-it-is-to-find-or-shortlist-java-resumes-1024x536.jpg" alt="Going Crazy Shortlisting Java Full Stack Developer Resume - Hire Uplers Certified Talent" width="625" height="327" srcset="https://www.uplers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/difficult-it-is-to-find-or-shortlist-java-resumes-1024x536.jpg 1024w, https://www.uplers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/difficult-it-is-to-find-or-shortlist-java-resumes-300x157.jpg 300w, https://www.uplers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/difficult-it-is-to-find-or-shortlist-java-resumes-768x402.jpg 768w, https://www.uplers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/difficult-it-is-to-find-or-shortlist-java-resumes-624x327.jpg 624w, https://www.uplers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/difficult-it-is-to-find-or-shortlist-java-resumes-500x262.jpg 500w, https://www.uplers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/difficult-it-is-to-find-or-shortlist-java-resumes.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" /></p>
<h2><b>Shortlisting Full Stack Java Developer Resumes: The Drill of Sourcing With Facts</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The demand for tech professionals continues to grow each year, but the supply doesn&#8217;t keep up. In fact, an</span><a href="https://www.indeed.com/insights/impact-of-tech-talent-shortage"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Indeed survey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reported that 86% of IT recruiters find it difficult to hire technical talents.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The limited pool of available talents with the right academic background, professional skill sets, and adequate soft skills are the biggest reasons why IT recruiters are not able to find candidates that match their job requirements. There may be plenty of applications you receive from your job board but you might struggle to find candidates who have the expertise that you need.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-31299" src="https://www.uplers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Java-Developer-Hire-Skill-Gap-1024x726.jpg" alt="Skill Gap Insights for Tech Talent - Hire Uplers Certified Talent" width="625" height="443" srcset="https://www.uplers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Java-Developer-Hire-Skill-Gap-1024x726.jpg 1024w, https://www.uplers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Java-Developer-Hire-Skill-Gap-300x213.jpg 300w, https://www.uplers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Java-Developer-Hire-Skill-Gap-768x545.jpg 768w, https://www.uplers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Java-Developer-Hire-Skill-Gap-1536x1090.jpg 1536w, https://www.uplers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Java-Developer-Hire-Skill-Gap-624x443.jpg 624w, https://www.uplers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Java-Developer-Hire-Skill-Gap-500x355.jpg 500w, https://www.uplers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Java-Developer-Hire-Skill-Gap.jpg 1748w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Source: McKinsey &amp; Company)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A lot of candidates also lack formal IT education. While looking through full stack java developer resumes, you will notice that a lot of candidates do not have a sound educational background. But, owing to the ongoing talent crunch and skill gap, it is mostly recommended to prioritize skills-first hiring. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-31309 size-full" src="https://www.uplers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Skill-First-Hiring-Java-Developers-1.jpg" alt="Skills-First Hiring of Full Stack Java Developers" width="625" height="367" srcset="https://www.uplers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Skill-First-Hiring-Java-Developers-1.jpg 625w, https://www.uplers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Skill-First-Hiring-Java-Developers-1-300x176.jpg 300w, https://www.uplers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Skill-First-Hiring-Java-Developers-1-500x294.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet another challenge is that your company needs to stand out from the competitors. When it comes to java developer jobs, we are facing more demand and less supply. Candidates have a lot of options which means your company needs to stand out so that candidates prefer you over the competitors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While looking for the right java developer can be overwhelming, you can make things a tad bit easy by having a look at their work portfolio. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As already emphasized above, skills-first hiring means reviewing the work portfolio of a java developer and mapping it with your requirements. This will help streamline your search for skilled and qualified full stack java developer resumes to a great extent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’ll be able to find relevant information such as checking the type of code they use or screenshots from applications they created. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some candidates even show off their work on social media pages where you’ll be able to see their work in all its glory!</span></p>

They will have the proper knowledge about database management systems (DBMS) such as MySQL, Oracle or MongoDB, and others. These database systems store data that powers user interface components. These components are websites, mobile applications, and desktop client tools.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They must also have exposure to different java frameworks, libraries, APIs, paradigms, core java concepts (includes OOP, design patterns in java, abstract class, serialization, interface, etc), SOLID principles, architectural patterns, and more. These are essential for modern website and software development, especially the ones where agility and security are a must. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apart from these above must-need skills, below are the skills that you should review in a java full stack resume that will make the candidate stand out! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These are some niche and pro-level java full stack skills and will help you get complex development support and enable build high-end applications. </span></p>
<h3><strong>1. Spring</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you review a full stack java developer&#8217;s resume for interview and hire, you must look for their expertise in the Spring framework. Here’s why!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spring is a lightweight, open-source framework used to develop enterprise applications. It not only makes development easier and quicker but also ensures higher productivity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spring framework allows the use of dependency injection feature enabling objects to define dependencies on their own which the spring container injects later into them. Its structure is similar to the model view controller pattern. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The spring framework is also used to execute built-in support for complex and typical tasks including data binding, validation, type conversion, and more. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, it integrates with Java EE technologies like AMQP (advanced message queuing protocol), RMI (remote method invocation), etc.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The candidate you hire should have proven expertise in the spring framework. This is a hard skill to attain but the top in-demand java requirement of 2022. </span></p>
<h3><strong>2. Cloud computing</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have seen an increased need to cut down time-to-market, eliminate bugs and publish frequent updates. Hence. developers need to cope-up with the evolving demands.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is when cloud computing can be at your rescue. While looking at a full stack Java developer resume, make sure you check if the candidate has any experience with cloud computing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Especially for remote hiring, cloud computing can serve as a boon. Cloud computing allows sharing of internet-based resources between devices.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Further, when a developer is familiar with cloud computing, it will provide you with an added benefit of less maintenance. This is because all the updates happen automatically. You can also access your data from anywhere with an internet connection!</span></p>
<h3><strong>3. Multiple programming languages</strong></h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Such a candidate will be curious to learn new things to keep their skills sharp.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Knowing more than one programming language means that the developer’s skills will never become outdated. They will be able to adapt to industry trends. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The top java developers with a vast experience pool tend to have exposure to several programming languages that mostly include Java, SQL, REST APIs, HTML, JavaScript, Node.js, React, Solidity, Scala, Python, etc., to name a few.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Microservices are small-scale software applications implemented in the Java programming language. These microservices work together to generate a larger solution.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your developer will be able to tailor these services as per your specific needs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Usually, when code is reused it increases complexity. With microservices,  every project will have its own unique setup ensuring minimal risk of future code repetition or optimization difficulty. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Microservices also allow implementing of end-to-end testing for your system.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This means that you can overcome any possible gaps between different microservices. This ensures that messages are being exchanged and all additional network infrastructure is configured. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A developer who is familiar with microservices will ensure that the whole business process meets performance and security standards.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s important that the full stack java developer you shortlist have exposure to microservices and should be aware of Docker container, DURS principles, and more. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Quick building, testing, and deploying &#8211; SOA  enables it all. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is one of the most powerful tools to enable loose coupling between software components so that they can be reused.</span></p>
